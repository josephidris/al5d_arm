# sample servo config file for a Lynxmotion AL5C arm with wrist rotate and gripper
#   - servos are attached to headers 0-4 in order from base to gripper
#     then (optional) wrist rotate on header 5

# hmm - I would like to specify degrees here, but at least for diamondback,
#   .yaml files referenced through a launch <rosparam> file don't actually
#   go through rosparam processing. It looks like this will be fixed in
